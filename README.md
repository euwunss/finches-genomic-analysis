# finches-genomic-analysis
This project explores the genetic variation in Darwin's finches, focusing on the ALX1 gene, which has been shown to influence beak shape.
Inspired by the work of Lamichhaney et al. (2015), Evolution of Darwin’s finches and their beaks revealed by genome sequencing (Nature 518:371–375), we examine genetic data from four species of finches and an outgroup, Loxigilla noctis (the Lesser Antillean Bullfinch). By analyzing DNA sequences, beak morphology, and shape scores from a provided dataset, we aim to deepen our understanding of how genetic differences contribute to the observed diversity in beak forms.

# Data:
The project uses a CSV file (finches.csv) containing:

Species: Scientific name of the finch species  
Individual ID: Unique identifier for each bird  
Allele: A or B (diploid representation)  
Gene sequence: DNA sequence for a portion of the ALX1 gene  
Beak shape score: Quantitative measure of beak pointedness  
Beak type: Categorical classification ('blunt', 'pointed', or 'deep-wide')  
By processing this data, we investigate the correlation between genetic sequences and the phenotypic variation in finch beaks.
